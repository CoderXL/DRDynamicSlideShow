DRDynamicSlideShow
==================

An UIScrollView subclass to easily implement an amazing touch interactive and dynamic slide show, as IFTTT's.

[DEMO VIDEO COMING SOON]

No external frameworks or UIView subclasses for subviews needed. Just add a `DRDynamicSlideShow` to your view, and use `DRDynamicSlideShowEffect`'s to let the magic happen.

You can check out the example app if you want so you can figure out how it's exactly implemented.

## LICENSE

You can use it for whatever you want, however you want. I just would love to know if you're using it in any project of yours.
