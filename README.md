DRDynamicSlideShow
==================

An UIScrollView subclass to easily implement an amazing touch interactive and dynamic slide show, as IFTTT's.

[Demo Video](https://vimeo.com/75512444) (new one coming soon).

No external frameworks or UIView subclasses for subviews needed. Just add a `DRDynamicSlideShow` to your view, and use `DRDynamicSlideShowEffect`'s to let the magic happen.

You can check out the example app if you want so you can figure out how it's exactly implemented.

## Known issues

- The animation used to go to next page by tapping the view does not consider `DRDynamicSlideShowEffect`'s `delay` property.

## LICENSE

You can use it for whatever you want, however you want. I just would love to know if you're using it in any project of yours.
